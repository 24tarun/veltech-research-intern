# Veltech Research Intern

During my time as a research intern at Veltech, I worked on four projects funded by the Department of Biotechnology India. Here is a short summary of each project:

1. **Industry 4.0 Prognostic Module:** Developed a module that utilized Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) graphs to analyze and detect machine anomalies. This module was designed for implementation in an Industry 4.0 environment.

2. **Machine Learning Mobile Application:** Created a mobile application using MIT App Inventor that achieved 97% accuracy in identifying rice leaf diseases. Machine learning techniques were employed to enable accurate disease diagnosis.

3. **Water Quality Monitoring System for Shrimp Aquaculture:** Structured a system of sensors to monitor water quality and dynamics in shrimp aquaculture. This system resulted in a significant reduction (over 80%) in shrimp fatality and increased yield by more than 2x.

4. **System Application for LED Plant SCM Simulation:** Designed a system application that simulated Supply Chain Management (SCM) for a local LED plant. The application incorporated an MQTT server system and proximity sensors, which contributed to a 100% reduction in faulty LEDs.

For more detailed information and explanations about these projects, please refer to my internship report.
